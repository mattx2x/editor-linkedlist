Go is an open source programming language that makes it simple to build secure, scalable systems.
Golang is useful for carrying out programming for scalable servers and large software systems. 
The Golang programming language was built to fill in the gaps of C++ and Java that Google came 
across while working with its servers and distributed systems.

Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.
Rust was built to support system-level programmers who write low-level, byte-tweaking code. 
It offers access to the raw bits and expects programmers to use it. The language is designed to 
cohabitate with much of the old C or assembly language code that's part of the lower levels of 
operating systems and network stacks.

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. 
Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the 
Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
Kotlin is a modern statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that 
helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.

C# is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, 
strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
Like other general-purpose programming languages, C# can be used to create a number of different programs and applications: 
mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. Lots and lots of games.
